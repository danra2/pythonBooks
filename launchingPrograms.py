#Popen() stands for process open and it's apart of the subprocess module.
#Unlike threads, a process cannot directly read and write another processes' vairables.
# If you think of a multithreaded program as having multiple fingers following source code,
# then having multiple processes of the same program open is like having
# a friend with a separate copy of the programâ€™s source code. You are both
# independently executing the same program.

#Poll tells if you if the other instance of the program has yet finished running.
#Wait tells us until this program is done running don't run etc kind of like a promise.

#The first argument is the location and name of the program itself
#The second argument is the script you want it to run or read from following opening.
